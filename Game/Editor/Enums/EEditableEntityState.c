/** @ingroup Editable_Entities
*/ 

/*!
State of editable entity (SCR_EditableEntityComponent).

Entities of each state are managed by SCR_EntitiesManagerEditorComponent.

There is a strict order in which entities of various states are nested.
For example, ACTIVE entity is always VISIBLE and UNLOCKED.

States on the same level can overlap, e.g., ACTIVE entity can also be RENDERED.
